Double Spending Problem
Double spending means spending the same Bitcoin in more than one transaction.
Example:
Sending the same Bitcoin to two different persons at the same time.
________________________________________
Preventing Double Spending
•	Group of transactions is time-stamped
•	Transaction details are sent to all or many nodes in the network
•	Blockchain is constantly growing & each block prevents double spending
•	Blockchain ensures that any modification in block will lead to recomputing of following blocks
•	Anyone can validate transaction & prevent double spending
________________________________________
Bitcoin Attacks
Bitcoin network is vulnerable to cyber attacks and fraud, providing tamper-proof ledger of transactions.
People with malicious intent can exploit known vulnerabilities in blockchain technology and have been successful in several hacks and frauds over years.
________________________________________
Hackers and Fraudsters Threaten Blockchain in 4 Primary Ways
1.	Phishing
2.	Sybil attack
3.	Routing
4.	51% attack
________________________________________

Sybil Attack
Hacker creates and uses many fake network identities to flood network and crash the system.
Sybil refers to famous book character diagnosed with multiple identity disorder.
________________________________________
Types of Sybil Attacks
1. Direct Attack
Sybil node directly influences honest node
 		Sybil node → Honest node
2. Indirect Attack
Sybil node influences middle node which in turn influences honest node
 		Sybil node → Middle node → Honest node
________________________________________
Why Sybil Attack is Done
•	To take control of network and allow malicious blocks & transactions
•	To prevent transactions from being confirmed
•	To reverse transactions
•	To perform double spending
________________________________________
Prevent Sybil Attack
1.	Proof of Work consensus algorithm is used to prevent Sybil attack on Bitcoin
2.	Many miners exist across different geographical regions
3.	Transactions are verified by every node and rejected as invalid if faulty transaction are included in block
________________________________________
Node: System + Blockchain software server
Phishing
Phishing is scamming attempt to attain user’s credentials.
	Fraudster sends email to wallet key access that appears to come from legitimate source
	Email asks users for their credentials using fake hyperlinks
________________________________________
Crypto Phishing
•	Cyber criminals try to steal cryptocurrency from owners.
•	Cyber criminals act as providers (exchange, wallet and soon) and send phishing emails.
________________________________________
Different Ways of Crypto Phishing
1.	Google Ad word phishing
2.	Chat phishing
3.	Message phishing
4.	Social media phishing
5.	Email phishing
________________________________________
Routing Attack
Blockchain rely on real time large data transfers. Hackers can intercept data while it is being transferred to internet service providers.
	In routing attack, blockchain participant typically can’t see threat, so everything looks normal
	However, behind scene fraudsters have extracted confidential data or transactions
________________________________________
Impact of Routing Attack
Eg: Bitcoin where miners solve puzzle to create new block & send that block to network for confirmation.
Imagine attacker does not allow block to reach Blockchain and delays it until another miner solves same block and gets reward. The actual miner however does not get any reward.
Delaying time to solve puzzle________________________________________
BGP: Border Gateway Protocol is glue that holds internet together by disseminating information about how to reach destination in remote network. (Individual)  
ASes: Internet is made up of approximately 67,000 autonomous systems. Each with its own AS number (ASN) and set of IP prefixes. (Group)
Another problem arises when 50% of Bitcoin nodes are concentrated in 3 countries only and it is difficult to imagine China alone has around 80% of Bitcoin mining pool in world.
According to research, 60% of Bitcoin connections use only 3 ASes & if an attacker hacks these 3 ASes they can disrupt Bitcoin network.
________________________________________
51% Attack Points
1.	Mining especially for large scale public blockchain requires a significant amount of computing power
2.	If miner / group of miners could rally enough resources they could attain more than 50% of blockchain mining power
3.	Having more than 50% of power means having control over ledger and ability to manipulate it
Private blockchains are not vulnerable to 51% attack.

Bitcoin Networks
•	Bitcoin is an ad-hoc network with mesh topology
•	Protocol runs on TCP 8333.  [TCP – Transmission Control Protocol]
•	All the nodes are treated equally in Bitcoin network
•	New node can join network anytime and non-responsive nodes are removed after 3hrs
________________________________________
Two Types of Bitcoin Networks
1. Main Network - Actual network on which all cryptocurrency exchange and transactions are conducted
2. Test Network - Network that mimics behaviour of main network and is used to test new applications and scripts
________________________________________
Bitcoin Nodes
1. Full Node
Implementation of Bitcoin core client Performing wallet, memory, blockchain storage Network routing function
2. Light Node
Capable of only wallet and networking routing functionality
________________________________________
Joining Bitcoin Network
Steps performed to join Bitcoin network as an active node (miner):
Requesting seed node → Retrieving Address list → Selecting peer node → Updating network
Step 1: Requesting Seed Node
There are certain special nodes in Bitcoin network called seed nodes that have a list of all active full nodes. New joining nodes ask for list of addresses from seed node.
Step 2: Retrieving Address List
Seed node sends them addresses in response to node request to join network.

Step 3: Selecting Peer Node
Joining node selects address from list & requests to join network.
Step 4: Updating Network
A newly joined node gets most recent copy of blockchain peers.
________________________________________
Bitcoin Mining
Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoin by solving complex mathematical problems.
1.	Verify the legitimacy of transaction
2.	Include the verified transaction in block
3.	PoW consensus among all the active nodes generates valid nonce
4.	A new block is added to chain once consensus is achieved

Mining:
Mining:  Limited supply ↓
Demand ↑  Price ↑
Eg: Gold
Block reward is high for  blocks Halving
